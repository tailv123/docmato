# DocMato
>The project aims to develop a website that will serve as a comprehensive platform for tomato farmers and virology enthusiasts in Victoria, to explore characteristics and answer queries related to tomato-based Mosaic virus and its subtypes. The project will proceed in 3 iterations with the fully functional shippable product going live after the first iteration with features that provide immediate information-based assistance to users right away. Subsequent increments will be delivered with each passing iteration to add enhanced functionality in an attempt to provide the complete technology package that helps users understand, research, incorporate preventive measures and ultimately avoid losses incurred due to Mosaic-Virus spread across tomato crops.

# Motivation
>Every year Victorian tomato farmers face huge losses due to the viral spread of Mosaic Virus that destroys their crops. Absence of an effective digital platform that creates
awareness and establishes prescribed preventive measures is the need of the hour.

# Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

# Installation

Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

# API Reference
Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

# Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
