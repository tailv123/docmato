Questions,Answer
What are Mosaic Virus?,"Mosaic viruses affect more than 150 types of plants, including many fruits, vegetables, and flowers. The disease is characterized by leaves that are mottled with yellow, white, and light or dark green spots and streaks . Some of the most commonly infected plants include tomatoes, squashes, cauliflower, and cucumbers, but many more plants are susceptible."
Types of Mosaic Virus?,"Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV), Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV), Bean Common Mosaic Virus (BCMV), Bean Yellow Mosaic Virus (BYMV)."
How to identify Mosaic Virus?,"The leaves are mottled with yellow, white, and light and dark green spots. Plants may have other deformities and their leaves may be crinkled or wavy."
How to treat Mosaic Virus for infected plants ?,Remove all infected plants and destroy them; Monitor the rest of plants closely; Disinfect gardening tools after every use.
How to prevent Mosaic Virus?,Plant virus-resistant varieties; Try to cover plants with a floating row cover or aluminum foil mulches to prevent insects (e.g. aphids and leafhoppers) from infecting plants; Control weeds; Soak seeds of susceptible plants in a 10% bleach solution before planting.
What Plants will be affected?,"Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Cauliflower, Squash (Zucchini), Watermelons, Green Beans, etc."
How does TMV transmit？,"TMV is very easily transmitted when an infected leaf rubs against a leaf of a healthy plant, by contaminated tools, and occasionally by workers whose hands become contaminated with TMV after smoking cigarettes."
How long can mosaic viruses live in the dirt?,"The mosaic virus can overwinter in the roots of perennial weeds, flowers, and some crops plants. It grows with the plant in the spring, appearing in the upper leaves. However, it can not live in extremely dry conditions. As for planting now, avoid plants varieties that are susceptible to the cucumber mosaic virus; grow resistant cultivars and use resistant seeds. Consider using row covers to prevent aphids from reaching plants in the first place (aphids bring on CMV). This page from the Tennessee cooperative extension service provides a list of vegetables and varieties and resistance: https://extension.tennessee.edu/publications/documents/SP277-K.pdf"
Would parsley and raspberries be susceptible to the mosaic virus?  Would pruning out infected growth on the raspberries help control? ,"Yes, mosaic viruses can affect both raspberries and celery. Cutting out infected material can slow the virus spread to adjacent plants, but it will not cure the infected plant. Unfortunately, once a plant has contracted a mosaic virus, it will always be infected."
Can i eat tomatoes with mosaic virus?,"We suggest that when in doubt, throw it out, especially if the harvested part is a part that is directly affected, such as leaves. If fruit shows no blemishes, it might be OK to eat it, even if the rest of the plant shows symptoms. Some diseases only cause cosmetic damage to the fruit, not internal, and would be fine to eat. Others, though, that attack the interior of the fruit will likely, at the very least, affect quality and flavor. Most plant diseases are not transferable to humans. Some bacteria, etc., are, however, or some fungi, although not harmful directly, can produce compounds that are. If a plant is weakened, secondary infections may also arise."
Is mosaic virus harmful to humans?,Plant viruses do not replicate or cause infection in humans or other mammals.
What is the suitable temperature for mosaic virus?,20- 25 degree Celsius.
What are the effects of Tomato Mosaic Virus on Yield?,"(1) Mosaic: Slight mosaic or uneven green mottles occur on the leaves, the plant growth and development are normal, the plant height is the same as that of a healthy plant, the leaves are not small, deformed, and the plant is not dwarfed. Has little effect.(2) Thick and light mottles occur on the leaves, and then the new leaves become smaller, the veins become purple, the leaves are slender, narrow, and twisted. The top leaves of the stem grow stagnant, the plants are short, the lower leaves are mostly roll-shaped, the flower bud differentiation ability is reduced, a large number of flowers and buds are already set, the fruit is small, and the fruit is inferior and has a flower-faced shape. It has a great impact on yield, and the yield of diseased plants is 10% to 30% lower than that of healthy plants."
What's the differences between tomato mosaic virus and tobacco mosaic virus?,"Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) are hard to distinguish. Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) can cause yellowing and stunting of tomato plants resulting in loss of stand and reduced yield. ToMV may cause uneven ripening of fruit, further reducing yield. Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was once thought to be more common on tomato. TMV is usually more of a tobacco pathogen than a tomato pathogen."
How does cucumber mosaic virus affect lettuce?,"Infected plants show symptoms of chlorosis, stunting and often do not properly head."
what is the CMV?,"This virus was first found in cucumbers (Cucumis sativus) showing mosaic symptoms in 1934, hence the name Cucumber mosaic. Since it was first recognized, it has been found to infect a great variety of other plants. These include other vegetables such as squash, melons, peppers, beans, tomatoes, carrots, celery, lettuce, spinach and beets, various weeds and many ornamentals and bedding plants, such as Narcissus. Symptoms seen with this virus include leaf mosaic or mottling, yellowing, ringspots, stunting, and leaf, flower and fruit distortion."
What's the disease cycle of cucumber mosaic virus?,"When it is transmitted by aphids, this virus has an acquisition period of five to ten seconds and an inoculation period of about a minute. CMV can overwinter in perennial plants and weeds, as it can survive the winter in the roots of the plant and move to the aerial parts in spring, where it can be transmitted by aphids to other plants."
How to cure with the cucumber mosaic virus?,"Currently there is no chemical capable of removing this virus from an infected plant, and therefore the best control is prevention of the infection and eradication. To achieve this, it is crucial to remove weeds and diseased plants from the field, as well as use clean and sanitized tools. Another option consists of the use of resistant varieties or the so-called ""trap crops"". Note: insecticides are ineffective as a control measure for CMV as they do not work quickly enough to prevent aphids from acquiring and transmitting virus."
How does cucumber mosaic virus affect cucumber?,"Specifically CMV can cause cucumbers to turn pale and bumpy. The leaves of these plants turn mosaic and their rugosity is often changed, making leaves wrinkled and misshapen. Growth of these plants is usually stunted and produces few flowers. Often cucumber fruits are oddly shaped and appear gray. This appearance often leads to cucumbers being referred to as ""white pickles"". Often infected cucumbers are bitter."
How does cucumber mosaic virus affect celery?,CMV can cause streaking and spotting and can be often confused with symptoms of the celery mosaic virus.
Host and pathogen of ToMV?,"ToMV infects tomato most commonly, but the virus can also infect pepper, potato, apple, pear, cherry and numerous weeds, including pigweed and lamb's quarters."
Host and pathogen of TMV?,"TMV has a very wide host range, affecting numerous crops, ornamentals and weeds including cucumber, lettuce, beet, pepper, tomato, petunia, jimson weed and horsenettle."
Tomato mosaic virus symptoms?,"Mottled light and dark green on leaves. If plants are infected early, they may appear yellow and stunted overall. Leaves may be curled, malformed, or reduced in size. Spots of dead leaf tissue may become apparent with certain cultivars at warm temperatures. Fruits may ripen unevenly. Reduced fruit number and size. Yellowish rings may form if fruit ripens in warm weather. Fruits may show internal browning just under the skin (brownwall). Symptoms may be suppressed during cool temperatures. As a result, infected seedlings may not display symptoms until moved to a warm environment."
Biology and disease cycle of TMV and ToMV ?,"Tomato mosaic virus and tobacco mosaic virus can exist for two years in dry soil or leaf debris, but will only persist one month if soil is moist. The viruses can also survive in infected root debris in the soil for up to two years. Seed can be infected and pass the virus to the plant but the disease is usually introduced and spread primarily through human activity. The virus can easily spread between plants on workers' hands, tools, and clothes with normal activities such as plant tying, removing of suckers, and harvest. The virus can even survive the tobacco curing process, and can spread from cigarettes and other tobacco products to plant material handled by workers after a cigarette. Proper hand washing and sterilization of tools and equipment is essential to preventing spread this disease. Once inside a plant, the virus multiplies resulting in the symptoms described above."
What are the most important fruits and vegetables affected by CMV?,"Peppers, bananas, tomatoes and cucurbits."
How does cucumber mosaic virus affect peppers?,"CMV in peppers causes slightly different symptoms than the previously mentioned. Pepper plants often have severe foliar damage, shown as mosaic and necrotic rings. Often the peppers themselves are misshapen and contain chlorotic rings and spots."
How does cucumber mosaic virus affect tomatos?,"Tomato plants are usually stunted and have poorly shaped leaves, or ""fernleaf"", when infected by CMV. Also certain strains of CMV can cause partial or total crop loss."
How does Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) spread?,"The virus is transmitted to the crop by many species of aphids, such as the cabbage aphid, the false cabbage aphid and the green peach aphid."
What temperature is good for the expression of CaMV symptoms in plants?,16-20 degree Celsius.
What are the symptoms of Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV)?,"Only members of the crucifer family are susceptible to CaMV. Systemic symptoms consist of a clearing or chlorosis along leaf veins (vein clearing). This is often seen first at the base of a leaf. Later, symptoms appear as dark green areas along veins (vein banding) and necrotic spotting of the leaf. Chinese cabbage is particularly susceptible to CaMV. In addition to vein clearing, a striking mosaic may develop with light and dark green areas on leaves. Plants can be stunted. Internal necrotic spotting in stored cabbage has been attributed to CaMV infection."
Can mosaic virus live in soil?,"Mosaic virus overwinters on perennial weeds and is spread by insects that feed on them. Aphids, leafhoppers, whiteflies and cucumber beetles are common garden pests that can transmit this disease. Soil, seed, starter pots and containers can be infected and pass the virus to the plant."
What are common tomato viruses?,"Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV), Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)"
How does cucumber mosaic virus affect tomato?,"Tomato plants infected with CMV in the early stages are yellow, bushy and considerably stunted. The leaves may show a mottle similar to that caused by Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV). The most characteristic symptom of CMV is filiformity or shoestring-like leaf blades"
What is tobacco mosaic virus caused by?,"Tobacco mosaic virus is usually spread from plant to plant via 'mechanical' wounds caused by contaminated hands, clothing or tools such as pruning shears and hoes. This is because TMV occurs in very high concentrations in most plant cells."
Symptoms associated with TMV infections ?,"mosaic pattern of light and dark green (or yellow and green) on the leaves, malformation of leaves or growing points, yellow streaking of leaves (especially monocots), yellow spotting on leaves, distinct yellowing only of veins."
How can we prevent tobacco mosaic virus from spreading?,"Frequently wash your hands and disinfect garden tools, stakes, ties, pots, greenhouse benches, etc. (one part bleach to 4 parts water) to reduce the risk of contamination. Avoid working in the garden during damp conditions (viruses are easily spread when plants are wet). Avoid using tobacco around susceptible plants."
How can we prevent tomato mosaic virus spread ? ,"If ToMV or TMV is confirmed, employ stringent sanitation procedures to reduce spread to other plants, fields, tunnels and greenhouses. Completely pull up and burn infected plants. Do not compost infected plant material. After working with diseased plants, thoroughly disinfect all tools and hands as outlined above, For added security against spread, keep separate tools for working in the diseased area and avoid working with healthy plants after working in an area with diseased plants. At the end of the season, burn all plants from diseased areas, even healthy-appearing ones, or bury them away from vegetable production areas. Disinfect stakes, ties, wires or any other equipment between growing seasons using the methods noted above."
How is tomato mosaic virus spread?,"Seed can be infected and pass the virus to the plant but the disease is usually introduced and spread primarily through human activity. The virus can easily spread between plants on workers' hands, tools, and clothes with normal activities such as plant tying, removing of suckers, and harvest."
What are symtoms of Cucumber mosaic virus?,"Cucumber mosaic virus: Infected plants are stunted and often exhibit “shoestring sydrome,” which is a characteristic malformation in which the edges of the leaves fail to develop, with the leaf veins developing aslong, narrow strips. Tomatoes are small and misshapen."
How is cucumber mosaic virus spread?,"CMV is mainly transmitted by aphids, but it can also be mechanically spread by humans in some cases. However, the mechanically spreading of this virus is not as common as the case of other virus (such as Tobacco Mosaic Virus, TMV), because CMV is not a very stable virus."
What is Tomato Mosaic Virus?,"Tomato mosaic virus is a serious and extremely contagious disease. It is also hard to identify, with symptoms varying wildly depending upon the variety and age of the infected plant, the strain of the virus, and environmental conditions. To make matters worse, it is very hard to distinguish from the closely related tobacco mosaic virus."
What is TMV look like?,"TMV is a single-stranded RNA virus that commonly infects Solanaceous plants, which is a plant family that includes many species such as petunias, tomatoes and tobacco."
Can tobacco products carry TMV?,"Yes, tobacco products can carry the virus and using them without washing your hands afterwards can potentially spread TMV. For that reason, do not use tobacco in the greenhouse or without washing your hands prior to handling plant material."
What are treatments for TMV?,No chemicals cure a virus-infected plant.
Is there a vaccine for TMV?,There are no cures for viral diseases such as mosaic once a plant is infected.

How do you kill mosaic virus?,There are no cures for viral diseases such as mosaic once a plant is infected. 
How do we control ToMV?,"Seed can be infected and pass the virus to the plant but the disease is usually introduced and spread primarily through human activity. The virus can easily spread between plants on workers' hands, tools, and clothes with normal activities such as plant tying, removing of suckers, and harvest."
How do you treat tomato mosaic virus?,There are no cures for viral diseases such as mosaic once a plant is infected.
